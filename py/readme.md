# Python Unos - single file demo/utility projects

kbAsciiMaroo.py is a shell game, just a silly sidetrip I took while testing and experimenting with modules (msvcrt, colorama). Use it to amuse yourself when bored, or use it as a quick dump of an animated ascii chart.

ProcMon.py is Windows-specific, using the wmi module to keep track of process starts-and-stops.

genFA.py generates the guts of an HTML page (style and body) to display FontAwesome glyphs with their associated names & numbers.

More to come...
